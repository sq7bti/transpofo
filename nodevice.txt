Atari Portfolio and no file transfer device

   Sounds familiar? Unfortunately, I won't tell you how to copy files using psychokinetic abilities.  Instead I'll write about a brilliant idea by Viktor T. Toth, who found  out
   how to write programs on Portfolio without any external compiler. If you're an assembler  coder, you'll probably find it useful to write your own small applications. If  not,
   I'll try to put some listings on my blog, including a serial transmission program (that  is, the program that is not built-in, so you must copy it somehow to your  Portfolio;
   if you don't have a parallel interface or a card, you're in deep ass).

   The idea behind Viktor's solution was that you're - in  limited fashion - able to machine-code from within DOS. The  only obstacle is that not all ASCII codes may be  entered
   using keypresses (e.g. 03 - Ctrl+C ). His  workaround consists of two short programs that  don't contain any "illegal" codes, so you  can type them from DOS prompt. When  you
   have successfully finished the second one, you'll be able to "compile" text files with hex-coded programs. Now you only need to write your program on a regular PC, compile it
   to a .com file, view that file with a hex editor and re-type the codes on your Portfolio.

   The original step-by-step instructions are here, but I'll write a short tutorial, just in case 😉

   First, you need to create CAT.COM. This tiny  program allows you to enter any character  (except Ctrl+C and Ctrl+S) and redirect it to  a file. When in the DOS prompt,  press
   Atari+LOCK to turn on NUM LOCK and type:
   echo \180^G\128\196^A\205!\136\194\180^B\205!\235\241>cat.com
   NOTE: \xxx means "hold Alt and type three digits from the numeric (red) keyboard". You  should see a semigraphic character when you release Alt. ^x means Ctrl+X. ! is  simply
   an exclamation mark (Shift+1).

   If you made no mistakes, the file should be 17 bytes long and run without hanging the computer. And now, here comes the hard part. With CAT.COM you'll write the next program,
   H2C.COM, but this time the characters won't show up. Type:
   cat>h2c.com
   Now, make sure that NUM LOCK is on (the cursor changes to underline) and then hit the following keys:
   \180 ^H \205 ! < x t (
   < : | ^B ^D ^I \177 ^D
   \210 \224 $ \240 P \180 ^H \205
   ! < x t \233 < : |
   ^B ^D ^I $ ^O [ ^H \216
   \136 \194 \180 ^B \205 ! \235 \208
   \205 spc ^C
   If you're lucky, you'll get a 50-byte-long file.

   Now it's time to test the compiler. The example code on Viktor's page is long and complicated. Instead, open the built-in editor and type this:
   b4 09 ba 0b 01 cd 21 b4 4c cd 21 x
   without spaces and newlines! Save the file as HELLO.HEX and execute:
   h2c<hello.hex>hello.com
   Yet you have to  merge the text to  your code. You may  use either the text  editor or CAT.COM, but  remember to redirect CAT.COM's  output to append the  text to the end  of
   HELLO.COM:
   CAT.COM>>HELLO.COM
   Type:
   Hello world!$
   (the string must be terminated with $). Hit Ctrl+C (or save the file and hit Esc, when using editor).

   If everything went right, typing HELLO should result in the good old hello message.

   I don’t know whether you actually read comments so I don’t know if anyone will ever see this, however, I’ve come up with a better solution based on this article. Basically, I
   thought the whole “Write one program to write another to write a third” was a bit of a faff, so I came up with something that can be written directly from the command  prompt
   that can do something along the lines of  the final program. My program doesn’t use  Hexadecimal – that would make it far  too complicated to easily implement on the  command
   line – it instead uses Octal. All Octal  triplets should be separated by spaces (which  prompts the program to output the value of  the current total as a character and  then
   clear the total) and the string/file should be ended with a letter. No linebreaks are allowed, which is a bit of an issue, but shouldn’t cause too many problems.

   The program is called B8CAT.COM (abbreviation of “Base 8 CAT”, can be pronounced “B-8-Cat” or “Bate-Cat”, whichever’s easier) and is 40 Bytes in length.

   In the following listing, a number preceded by a “/” denotes ALT must be held before typing the number on the numpad (E.G. “/180” means “hold ALT and type 1 8 0”  (ALT+180)),
   a letter preceded by a “^”  denotes that CTRL must be  held before typing the letter (E.G.  “^A” means “hold CTRL and  press a” (CTRL+A)) and “” is  used in place of a  space
   character:

   /180 ^P /208 /236 /205 ! /168 /223 t ^Q /168 @ u ^U /131 /224 ^O /177 ^D /254 /201 /211 /226 ^A /194 /235 /229 /180 ^B /205 ! 1 /210 /235 /221 /205 /144

   As in the posted version, this should  be typed following “echo ” and before  “>B8CAT.COM”, E.G. echo ┤^Pðý═!¿▀t^Q¿@u^UâÓ^O▒^D■╔ËÔ^A┬ÙÕ┤^B═!1ÊÙ¦═ É>b8cat.com (your  character
   set may vary).

   The “/144” at the end isn’t strictly necessary, however I have noticed that ending the string with a space occasionally causes problems, so this adds a “NOP” to the end.

   I hope this information is of use.

      Using a little program I quickly wrote to output the contents of a file in Octal, I converted DEBUG.COM from the Original MS-DOS 2.0 disk (the Portfolio’s DIP DOS is based
      on MS-DOS 2.0) into a format that can be interpreted with B8CAT.COM. You can find the listing here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/eekyurmxcpd62zo/debug.oct

      It seems my original comment was stuffed up by wordpress. Here’s a second attempt at the part that got corrupted:

      In the following listing,  a number preceded  by a “/”  denotes ALT must  be held before  typing the number  on the numpad  (E.G. “/180” means  “hold ALT and  type 1 8  0”
      (ALT+180)), a letter preceded by a “^” denotes that CTRL  must be held before typing the letter (E.G. “^A” means  “hold CTRL and press a” (CTRL+A)) and “[spc]” is used  in
      place of a space character:

      /180 ^P /208 /236 /205 ! /168 /223 t ^Q /168 @ u ^U /131 /224 ^O /177 ^D /254 /201 /211 /226 ^A /194 /235 /229 /180 ^B /205 ! 1 /210 /235 /221 /205 [spc] /144

      Apologies for the inconvenience.

   Thanks for the feedback! Indeed, the “write-a-program-to-write-a-program-to-write-a-program” approach may be  a bit annoying, especially when you need to repeat the  sequence
   each time your Portfolio freezes to death 🙂 On the other hand, hexadecimal notation is a little bit easier to encode when paper-coding your program (or not?).

   PS. Don’t worry, people still read this post, so your advice can still save lives 😉

      As requested, I put in an afternoon of  work and managed to get a full  HEX version working! I’ve called it B16CAT.COM to  keep it separate from the above HEXCAT  program.
      B16CAT can be pronounced as either “B Sixteen Cat” or “Big Cat”, whichever takes your fancy.

      Here’s a listing. As usual, “\” is “ALT+”, “^” is “CTRL+” and “[SPACE]” is the space bar. I’ve spaced out the characters for easier reading:
      1 \210 \180 ^P \208 \236 \205 ! \168 @ u ^T \168 [SPACE] t \242 \168 ^P u ^P \168 ^A u ^X \180 ^B \205 ! 1 \210 \235 \226 ^D ^E ^D ^D $ ^O \177 ^D \211 \226 0 \228 ^A \194
      \235 \210 \205 [SPACE] \144

      When typed in, it should look something like this:
      echo 1Ò´^PÐìÍ!¨@u^T¨ tò¨^Pu^P¨^Au^X´^BÍ!1Òëâ^D^E^D^D$^O±^DÓâ0ä^AÂëÒÍ  >B16CAT.COM

         I forgot to mention: all  bytes represented in Hex should  be separated by spaces (E.G.  “4E 51 7A” etc) and  to exit the program, type  “!”. Also, line breaks will  be
         ignored, so, while your Hex code can include line-breaks, you should not use these as a replacement for spaces.

               I have created a version of MORE.COM that can be typed  in from the command line. It’s quite long, so it has  to be typed in in stages using the “>>” redirect  to
               append data to the end of the file. As usual, the “\” is “ALT+”, the “[SPACE]” is the space-bar and “^” is “CTRL+”.

               (The “characters” are separated by spaces for ease of reading – don’t enter these at the prompt):

   Hi,

   i recently got a pofo by a friend and now i’m  playing around with it. Got some problems creating h2c.com. It’s  always 52 bytes in size. i recreated cat.com but this  didn’t
   help. h2c doesn’t work.

   maybe it would help if you only use / and ^ in the code?

   BTW, is there any way to persist data on board or is there an internal battery i can change to keep data on “disk”?
   (a mmc card hack would be funny..)

      Congratulations on getting your hands on a Portfolio! It seems  that you misunderstood me a bit. The code generating  h2c.com isn’t meant to be typed exactly as it  reads.
      Instead, press Portfolio key+LOCK to turn on NumLock (the  cursor will change to an underscore) and then, when  you encounter a backslash followed by a number, press  Alt,
      type that number on the numeric keyboard (red digits) and release Alt. ^ means Control key; press Control, then a letter following the “^” sign, and release Control.

         I did understand this  but still, h2c.com is  about 52 bytes  long and i don’t  understand why. To my  mind, it would  prevent several mistakes if  there would only  be
         ALT-Codes or at least ALT and CTRL..
         I tried to translate this on my own now and hope this works..

         echo \180 ^G \128 \196 ^A \205 \136 \194 \180 ^B \205 33 \235 \241 > cat.com

         and for h2c (i’ll try it in next few hours..)

         \180 ^H \205 33 60 \120 \116 40
         60 58 \124 ^B ^D ^I \177 ^D
         \210 \224 36 \240 80 \180 ^H \205
         33 60 \120 \116 \233 60 58 \124
         ^B ^D ^I 36 ^O 91 ^H \216

            Getting 50 Bytes for h2c.com now but my hello.com is 0 bytes in size and h2c.com doesn’t end running, so i had to reset the portfolio.

            btw. i even saw that this discussion system erases \ 0 .. since my code only has CTRL and ALT in it (besides the spc) the rest has to be a ALT-0 plus the two digits…

               You know, usually the devil is in the details – maybe you made a mistake  when typing alt-codes? If you print out the contents of h2c.com using type h2c.com,  you
               should see if your codes have been translated to the characters from this post (like “!”, “x” etc.).

      > a mmc card hack would be funny..
      I agree 😉
      So far there’s no such mod available, however there were succesful attempts to make  the Portfolio read CF cards. There are instructions on the Internet, so if you’re  not
      afraid of a soldering iron, you can easily make your Pofo read CF’s.
      For various hardware mods, take a look at http://pofowiki.de (in German).
